Software needed: 

- KiCAD (export PDF, negative), 
- Inkscape (Open PDF, Change all tracks to paths, combine, draw rectangle over area, difference with background, export SVG), 
- LaserWeb (Open SVG, Laser Fill Path, 0.09 Line distance, 100% power, 1000mm/min, 3 passes then 3 passes perpendicularly, generate Gcode)
- LaserGRBL (Open Gcode, verify homing and outline, play.) 

Single Line was useful to know what coating would work at being removed and how many passes were required, 
Calibration was used to find out what settings give the best outcomes,
Example PCB is a simple RGB LED circuit which is great to test on.
